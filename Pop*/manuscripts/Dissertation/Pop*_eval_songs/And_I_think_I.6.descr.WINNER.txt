And I think I

I spend a lot of time thinking and reading about being in love, and I read this tweet from my friend Joel Alcaraz posted Tuesday, June 12, 2018 at 06:34 PM:

"Itâ€™s interesting being in love with a person, I told Ashley my love for him is like dancing on the edge of a cliff always feeling a sense of trepidation before the grand leap into his world. But in the end no matter my fear I make a leap of faith. Is that what love is?"

It got me thinking about fear and love themes and I couldn't help but write this song:

"And I think I am just a lie 'Cause when you find yourself behind And I think I am just a lie"

At the beginning it was fear and love, however it really wound up with more of a deception and negative emotion theme. I hope that you like it.
