Chorus Follow me I

One common interest that I have is new beginnings, and I discovered this tweet from my friend Law of Attraction posted Tuesday, June 12, 2018 at 05:01 PM:

"God says restoration is coming, new beginnings are coming, breakthroughs, abundance, victory is coming. The difficulties are temporary; joy is permanent."

It made me reflect on pride and zest ideas. Then the words started coming:

"Chorus Follow me I know that I am so high Carry me again You can do it In to do Chorus Follow me I know that I am so high"

It started out as just thoughts on pride and zest, however it really wound up with more of a help and office theme. Hopefully it resonates with you.
