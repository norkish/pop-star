I am already in our lives

I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about new beginnings, so naturally this tweet caught my eye from my friend NotYourTypicalMILF posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 05:29 PM:

"through thick and thin, all of the happiness and sadness and bullshit life puts us through, and all of the new beginnings and all of the death and illnesses- I want Bryan by my side through it all."

It made me reflect on suffering and death ideas. Then the words started coming:

"I am already in our lives are Lonely lonely now I will never been the story I am already in our lives become the rightful owners of this heart of a bottle Laying from a long time gone by Do you stop trying so hard to remember my members Way Over yet Cos I knew that I I am already in our lives Television screen Despair Rise and the one that is mean"

I intended that the piece should be about suffering and death, but in the end I felt that it had more of a negative emotion and violence theme. In any case, I hope you find it meaningful.
