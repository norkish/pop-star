One common interest that I have is new beginnings, so naturally this tweet stood out from my friend . posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 01:48 PM:

"This love lives long And constantly unfurls new beginnings What are our Hearts doing without our knowledge?"

Thoughts started coming about love and optimism ideas and I couldn't help but write this song:

"It is lost be found If your heart And I am apart it is lost be found Are they meant go But I Just went against my will and if the war After night and I am sure It is because tomorrow Only me And for ever it is lost be found and some will come back home I still"

At the beginning it was love and optimism, but it turned out to have more of a negative emotion and domestic work theme. Hopefully it resonates with you.
