Lamps delve out and she can't be spared.
Eddies that she sought to dive im paired
Have
Brought her down upon her brain.
Oh she asks. she asks and feigns. 
Whis per ing:

Come out of things un known.
Shoot a grape fruit off her bones. 
And a
Trou ble that can't be dubbed.
The big foot's wait ing to be rubbed. 
Whis per ing:

They are. they are.

Un cer tain ty ne ver dies.
Closing doors and beep ing spies.

Come back and take you cav ern.
She could not die. that you now gov ern. 
Whis per ing: 

Come out up on their sea sons.
Cur sed missed py tha gor e ans. 
Is she 
A part of the clue?
Or is she part of the trea sons? 
Whis per ing:

They are. they are.
They are. they are.
They are. they are.

And no thing else re veals.
And no thing else re veals.
And no thing else re veals.

They are. they are.
