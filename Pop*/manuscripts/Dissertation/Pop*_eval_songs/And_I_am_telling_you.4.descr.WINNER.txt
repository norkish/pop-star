And I am telling you

I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about feeling depressed, so naturally this tweet caught my eye from my friend kat ðŸ¤¡ 17 posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 12:24 PM:

"@cassmckool depression is a mental illness not an emotion lol, if you're feeling sad then you're just sad, not 'feeling depressed.'"

It got me thinking about sadness and health ideas and I couldn't help but write this song:

"And I am telling you She calls me home Before you came to be And I am telling you ah A short stab of heartbreak It is sort of Sickening when You say it again to be released once again I am blue And I am telling you darling It is a heartache city hit"

I intended that the piece should be about sadness and health, but it turned out to have more of a suffering and pain theme. I hope that you like it.
