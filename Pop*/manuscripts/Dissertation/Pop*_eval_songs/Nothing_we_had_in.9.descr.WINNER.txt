Nothing we had in

I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about feeling depressed, so naturally this tweet stood out from my friend Juan Paolo posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 05:57 PM:

"When you're feeling depressed so you listen to depressing songs which makes your depression even worse."

It got me thinking about sadness and suffering ideas. That's how this piece sort of came together:

"Nothing we had in all the time Even care it is holding on You now nothing nothing we had in all the time Even"

It started out as just thoughts on sadness and suffering, however it really wound up with more of a healing and trust theme. In any case, I hope you find it meaningful.
