For those that know me, I pay attention to anything related to feeling depressed, and I stumbled on this tweet from my friend diego posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 06:56 PM:

"me: feeling depressed is an emotion thats not exclusive to people with a depressive disorder fake woke white girls: UMMM DEPRESSION IS A MENTAL ILLNESS YOU STUPID BITCH"

It got me thinking about sadness and hate themes and ultimately led me to compose this piece:

"After years of being hailed as your heart Looking up And see my pain through all the time There is you After years of being hailed as your heart Looking"

It started out as just thoughts on sadness and hate, but it turned out to have more of a horror and suffering theme. I hope that you like it.
