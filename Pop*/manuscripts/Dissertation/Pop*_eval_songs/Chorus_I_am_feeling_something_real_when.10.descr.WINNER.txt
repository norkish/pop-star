I spend a lot of time thinking and reading about being in love, so naturally this tweet caught my eye from my friend jai posted Tuesday, June 12, 2018 at 01:54 AM:

"that has to be the best part of being in love - the feeling of having a home in someone elseâ€™s brain"

Thoughts started coming about family and optimism ideas, and piece by piece out came this song:

"Chorus I am feeling something real when it hurts you It is a clue Chorus I am feeling something real when it is not me that you got it we in the world and a man in love again And I remember playing in the world in a hopeless and blind And we believe in lucky can a love and desire never Chorus I am feeling something real when it was love I am rid of"

It started out as just thoughts on family and optimism, however it really wound up with more of a optimism and affection theme. Hopefully you'll appreciate it.
