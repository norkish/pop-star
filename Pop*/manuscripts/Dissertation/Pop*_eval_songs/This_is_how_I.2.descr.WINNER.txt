I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about new beginnings, so naturally this tweet stood out from my friend Saraphon 🍍 posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 04:47 PM:

"I love Mondays!  New challenges.. new beginnings.. new hope.. and a continued determination... I love Mondays! 😊"

Thoughts started coming about love and optimism ideas. Then the words started coming:

"This is how I love the night sky do Your thing hey I was No way This is how I love the night sky"

It started out as just thoughts on love and optimism, but in the end I felt that it had more of a night and love theme. Hopefully it resonates with you.
