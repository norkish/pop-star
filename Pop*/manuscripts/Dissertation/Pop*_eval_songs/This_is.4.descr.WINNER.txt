I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about being in love, so naturally this tweet stood out from my friend Athea Butler posted Tuesday, June 12, 2018 at 12:41 PM:

"Being in love with someone you talk to daily who doesnâ€™t love you back is quite possibly the worst feeling of all time"

It got me thinking about optimism and affection themes and I couldn't help but write this song:

"This is the way the world We want love All of me this is the end The way you walk away I knew I finally confronting Strictly on a beautiful the way the love You Until the morning This is the one and great will be As in love 'til"

I intended that the piece should be about optimism and affection, however it really wound up with more of a positive emotion and love theme. Hopefully it resonates with you.
