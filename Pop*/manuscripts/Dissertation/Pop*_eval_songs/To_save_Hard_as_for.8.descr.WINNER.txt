To save Hard as for

I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about feeling depressed, and I found this tweet from my friend Linda Tran posted Monday, June 11, 2018 at 06:12 AM:

"And feeling depressed is not the same as feeling sad. So those two terms shouldn't be interchangable."

It made me reflect on sadness and hate ideas and ultimately led me to compose this piece:

"To save Hard as for the things I can or we could be sleeping on the wall Nothing to save Hard as for the things I can or"

At the beginning it was sadness and hate, but in the end I felt that it had more of a healing and heroic theme. Hopefully you'll appreciate it.
