When you
Words and music by Pop*
6 11, 2018

I find that I'm commonly drawn towards posts about new beginnings, so naturally this tweet caught my eye from my friend Jaime posted Tuesday, June 12, 2018 at 01:29 AM:

"@RichardTBurnett It’s a Wrap! Historic, massive,incredible. I love New Beginnings. ❤️MAGA 🇺🇸 https://t.co/xnc1q48Drk"

It made me reflect on love and optimism ideas and I couldn't help but write this song:

"When you I do love me You see When you I do"

At the beginning it was love and optimism, and I think that's what's conveyed through the music. Hopefully it resonates with you.
